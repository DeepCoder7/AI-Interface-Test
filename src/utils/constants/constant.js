The sources from the Indian Army said on Wednesday that the verification process is on and the modalities of patrolling will be decided by the ground commanders. Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong told reporters in Kolkata hours later that the two countries had reached "important understandings".
"There was a very important meeting between President Xi Jinping and PM Narendra Modi (on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Russia last week). Now that the two leaders have reached important understandings, they will be the guidelines for the further development of relations between our two countries. I hope that, under the guidance of this consensus, our relations will be moving forward smoothly in the future and they will not be restricted or interrupted by specific disagreements between our two sides," the ambassador said.
"As two neighbouring countries, it is natural that we have some differences and the most important thing is how to handle and solve them. The meeting of the two leaders has set a very good example for us on how to handle these differences," he added.`;
